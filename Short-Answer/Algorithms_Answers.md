## Exercise I

a)  O(n) even if the while loop runs as long as `a` is less then n^3, because inside the loop the `a` variable gets increased by the num squared >> O(n^2) therefore bringing the all iteration process back to just O(n) following a linear pattern, which increases at the same rate as the n input does.

b)


c)
